## Use the KeyStore Explorer tool and create a repository to store certificates. Use the JKS format. Import the certificates made available in the AVA.

### Question 1
Create a program that opens the repository you created and displays the following properties of the imported certificates:
a) Who is the owner of the certificate?
b) Who is the issuer of the certificate?
c) Identify whether the certificate is self-signed or not.
d) What is the validity period of the certificate?

### Question 2
Encrypt the image published in the AVA with the AES algorithm using the key consisting of 16 bytes with the character “A”.
Use the FURB public key to encrypt the key of the symmetric algorithm. Store the output in a binary file
called “key.aes”.
