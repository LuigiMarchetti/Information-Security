## Columnar Geometric Transposition Cipher
In this question, we will practice implementing the encryption algorithm known as the "Columnar Geometric Transposition Cipher."

To do this, develop a program that allows the user to encrypt and decrypt a text using this algorithm. Remember that to perform encryption and decryption, the user must be able to specify the number of columns in the matrix as a parameter.

Consider that the plaintext will contain only letters and spaces. The encryption algorithm must remove whitespace characters.

## Rail Fence Transposition Cipher
Implement the "Rail Fence Cipher" encryption algorithm. The algorithm should allow the user to submit a text to be encrypted. The program must also enable the decryption of texts using this algorithm.

This algorithm requires the user to provide the number of rails to be used as input.

Consider that the plaintext will contain only letters and spaces. The encryption algorithm must remove whitespace characters.
